Data Challenge: 2021
=========================================

In this edition of the annual PHME Data Challenge, participants are invited to demonstrate application of state-of-the-art algorithms and models to perform fault detection, classification and root cause identification for a manufacturing production line setup. In collaboration with the Swiss Centre for Electronics and Microtechnology (CSEM), exclusive access to rich datasets generated from a real-world industrial testbed has been provided for this competition.

For more information about the data challenge and to enroll in it, please viti the https://phm-europe.org/data-challenge web page.

Here we will post the datasets and basic jupyter notebooks.

Due to the training and validation dataset size, we split the experiments in two different folders. To obtain the password to access the experiment please register to the data challenge at https://phm-europe.org/data-challenge.

### NEW: The pipeline for the validation of the data challenge performance of the main tasks is now avaiable for download!
- TestPerformance.ipynb presents the Python code to run the full pipeline. 
The teams must replace current code inside of the TestClassification prototype with their code. 
The teams must keep the input and the ouput and the name of the TestClassification function unchanged. 
- Data/ contains a single input file given as sample to run the TestPerformance script
- data_challenge_evaluation contains a textual description of the meaning of each function of TestPerformance.ipynb 
- ClusterPerformance.ipynb presents the Python code to run the Clustering pipeline for the BONUS point. 
- data_challenge_CBonusPoint_evaluation contains a textual description of the meaning of each function of ClusterPerformance.ipynb
